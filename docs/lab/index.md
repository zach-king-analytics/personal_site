# 🔬 The Lab

The Lab is where my work is **alive**.

This section exists for experimentation, iteration, and learning — not polish for its own sake.  
It’s where ideas get pressure-tested, systems get sketched, and questions turn into working artifacts.

If **Work** shows what I’ve shipped and **Insights** show how I think,  
**The Lab shows how I explore.**

## What lives here

The Lab contains:

- exploratory analyses  
- experimental pipelines  
- prototype visualizations  
- data dumps and transformations  
- system sketches and notes  
- early versions of ideas that may later become full projects  

Some entries are rough.  
Some are deeply technical.  
Some are just interesting.

That’s intentional.

## Why this section exists

Real systems don’t appear fully formed.

They come from:
- curiosity  
- small bets  
- incremental refinements  
- noticing patterns early  
- asking *“what happens if…?”*  

The Lab makes that process visible.

For technical readers, this provides **depth and transparency**.  
For collaborators and hiring managers, it shows **craft and method** — not just outcomes.

It’s a signal that I:

- enjoy the work itself  
- think in systems  
- build from first principles  
- iterate toward clarity

## Relationship to the rest of the site

Some experiments in The Lab eventually mature into polished case studies and move into **Work**.

Many don’t — and that’s fine.

This section is deliberately unconstrained.  
Its job is not to sell, but to **demonstrate genuine engagement with complex problems**.

If something here resonates, chances are we’ll enjoy working together.

## How to read this section

You don’t need to read everything.

Skim what catches your attention.  
Follow the rabbit holes you care about.  
Treat it like walking past an open workbench.

Each page stands on its own, but together they form a picture of how I approach systems, data, and problem-solving in the real world.
