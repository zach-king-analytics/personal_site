# Work

Below you will find some projects that I work on in my spare time that have real-world application and are tied inherently to data workflows that have a strong parallel within an enterprise space.

## Personal Finance
A personal finance engine/workflow I've built over the past 5-7 years. Hosted on this personal website. The meat and potatoes will be
password protected, but reach out on the "Inquiries," tab if you'd like to see it. The writeup is available for your review.

**Coming soon** — End-to-end pipeline for personal financial data with dashboards and reporting.

## Recipe Studio
A data first solution to the dreaded question **"What are we going to cook tonight?"** Now, this could be bringing a nuke to a knife-fight, but
it works for me and it shows well.

**Coming soon** — Structured content, tagging, and publishing workflows for recipes.
